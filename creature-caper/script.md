## Preamble
<div class="scripted" markdown="1">
**While waiting for everyone to join, show <span class="text-uppercase">Waiting Room</span>.**

**After everyone arrives, show <span class="text-uppercase">Getting Started</span>.**
Thanks everyone for joining us tonight for Creature Caper, our online escape room. Does everyone have a pencil, paper, and the handout ready? Great! Some basic tips before we start:

* You get clues by interacting with objects or characters.
* What you see and hear will include everything that you need to solve the puzzles. I encourage you to speak up as you figure things out - it keeps everyone on the same page.
* Investigate each area thoroughly before moving to the next and take notes, but you don’t have to sketch maps or symbols. If you need to see something again, just ask.
* If you get stuck, you may be missing information. Leave, collect more clues, and come back later.
* And finally, once you use an object, you won’t have to use it again, so you can cross it off of your list. There’s one exception to this rule, but we’ll make it obvious.

Is everyone ready? Great! The clock starts now! Welcome to Creature Caper!

## Professor's Library, Newton, MA
<div class="scripted" markdown="1">
**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Evangeline and Jerry</span>.**
The message to come to the manor was urgent. “Tell no one,” it said.

The woman who ushers you into the library seems distracted. “Evangeline,” she says in lieu of a more formal introduction. “And this is Jerry, my husband’s assistant,” she adds, gesturing to the young man by the fireplace. “Thank you for coming. I’ve heard you’re the best, and I need the best. This is no ordinary case. You see…it’s my husband, the Professor. I’m sure you’ve heard of him. He’s the world’s foremost magizoologist, and a founding member of the Museum of Supernatural History. Well, he’s missing. It all started when the book he’s writing, a compendium of magical creatures, was stolen. Then creatures started disappearing. He set out to catch the culprit, and then we received this…” she hands you a telegram.

**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Telegram</span>.**
Creatures indeed missing, twelve thus far. Have reached the location of the latest creature-napping and am tracking a possible accomplice. If you do not hear from me by tomorrow evening, send help. Would share more, but I suspect I am being watched and my letters intercepted. 55 16 1 N. 6 28 21 W. The Professor.

“The future of the magical world is at stake,” Evangeline says. “So...will you take the case?”

`Note: The coordinates to Western Ireland, their next location, are contained in the telegram: 55 16 1 N, 6 28 21 W.`

**If anyone tries to be smart and says no:**
Why did you accept the invitation to come here tonight??

**Once they say yes, show <span class="text-uppercase">Backpack</span>.**
Before you begin searching for clues, you tuck the telegram into your trusty backpack--you’d never go into a new case without it. It’s pretty empty now, with only a bar of palmolive inside, so there’s plenty of room for evidence or useful tools you find.

**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Professor's Library</span>.**
Now that that’s taken care of, where would you like to look for clues first?
</div>

### Skull
<div class="scripted" markdown="1">
**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Chessboard</span>.**
“I hate that thing,” Jerry says, shuddering. “It’s James, the Professor’s previous assistant. He got too close to a dragon’s treasure...at the Professor’s urging, of course. Went about as well as you would guess. I can’t believe he keeps it...so morbid.
</div>

### Cloche (glass case)
<div class="scripted" markdown="1">

**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Chessboard</span>.** Examining the cloche, you decide to pick it up--and find a button underneath!

**If they push the button:**
Hmm, nothing seems to be happening.
</div>

### Bookcase
<div class="scripted" markdown="1">
**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Bookcase</span>.**
You peruse the Professor’s extensive book collection, noticing three of the shelves have been arranged by color. Something has been etched into the wood. It reads: Find the nonconformist in each group. They always have something interesting to say.

`Solution: Green shelf, book #7 (the only book with an odd number of stripes); blue shelf - book #4 (the only book with more stripes on the bottom than on the top); red shelf - book #6 (the only book that does not follow a repeating sequence).`

**If they pull out the correct 3 books, show <span class="text-uppercase">Books</span>.**
Congratulations, you’ve done it! What a strange collection of titles this man has curated...you wonder if he’s trying to tell you something...

`Solution: When read as a single phrase from left to right, it says: To acquire the key to the essentials, station the weight in the hearth.`

**If they place the paperweight in the hearth:**
Now you’re getting somewhere! The heft of the paperweight triggers a hidden panel to spring open. A small golden key drops to the ground.

**... then show them <span class="text-uppercase">Desk Key</span>. Go to the [Desk](#desk) section.**

`Note: The key can be used to open the Essentials desk drawer.`
</div>

### Desk
<div class="scripted" markdown="1">
**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Desk</span>.**
You check out the professor’s desk, guessing that’s where he’d stash important things.

**If they ask about the creature page, show <span class="text-uppercase">Creature Page</span>:**
“This is all that’s left of my husband’s book,” Evangeline explains. “He had a whole system worked out on how to categorize magical creatures.”

You study the page, noting that it includes the creature’s name, magical category, and some interesting stats such as power and health.

**If they ask about the paperweight:**
It’s got a good heft to it, and oddly enough, despite its prominent place upon the desk, it’s not being used.

**If they ask about the globe, go to the [Mechanical Globe](#mechanical-globe) section.**

**If they ask about the drawers:**
The desk has a number of drawers, one of which is labeled “essentials.”

**If they try to open it:**
Locked! What could he be hiding in there…

**If they open other drawers, show <span class="text-uppercase">Old Photo</span>.**
You try the other drawers, and the only thing even vaguely interesting that you find is an old, ripped wedding photograph.

**If they use the key to open the locked drawer, show <span class="text-uppercase">Essentials Drawer</span>.**
The drawer unlocks, and you discover a letter, a notebook, and what appears to be a dragon scale.

**If they ask about the letter, show <span class="text-uppercase">Professor's Letter</span>.**
You pick up the letter and quickly scan its contents. It reads:

---
*If you’ve found this, it means something terrible has befallen me. As a renowned sleuth and adventurer, it dings my pride that I have failed to single-handedly apprehend the creature-napper myself, and now I must turn to you in my hour of need. By finding this note, you have already proven your intelligence and shown that you are more than up to the task of rescuing me and the creatures alike.*

*However, wit alone will not suffice. You’re going to need a lot of magic, too. Thankfully, I can help you there. I find the fastest and most pleasant way to travel is by dragon magic, so please make use of my globe, a present from the Eldest herself. Place a gift given freely by a dragon in its basin, and prepare to be amazed!*

*Bon voyage et bonne chance!*

*The Professor*

---
**If they ask about the dragon scale:**
A rare and beautiful specimen indeed! Items such as this one have powerful magical properties.

**If they ask about the notebook, show <span class="text-uppercase">Map Notebook</span>.**
There are hundreds of pages of maps. Some have notes scribbled on them, as well as coordinates for longitude and latitude.

**If they look for the telegram coordinates in the notebook, show <span class="text-uppercase">Map of Ireland</span>.**
You’ve found it. The coordinates are for Western Ireland.
</div>

### Mechanical globe
<div class="scripted" markdown="1">
**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Mechanical Globe</span>.**
What a curious device. It has a shallow basin that seems to be meant to hold something and on the base there are two rows of 6 numerical dials, and a round button labeled ‘Open.”

`Note: The original coordinates on the globe are for the location of the Professor’s Manor. The players will need these coordinates to return to the Manor with the Professor later in the story.`

**If they fiddle with the number dials:**
What would you like to set them to?

**If they press the button without placing the scale in the basin:**
It doesn’t seem to do anything.

**If they attempt to set the incorrect coordinates:**
Be careful! You only have one dragon scale to use, so you better get this right!

**If they attempt to press the button with the right coordinates before looking at the map:**
Just as you’re about to hit the button to activate the mechanism, Evangeline catches your hand.  "Wait... do you even know where you are going...?"

**If they set the correct coordinates, place the dragon scale in the basin, and press GO:**

`Solution: 55 16 1 N, -6 28 21 W`

The scale begins to glow, getting brighter and brighter and brighter until a blinding light fills the entire room. Suddenly, it is extinguished. You cry out, startled by the portal in the middle of the library!

The view beyond is of a moonlit cavern. Cold ocean air prickles your skin. Where the dragon scale once lay, there is now only ash.

**... then show <span class="text-uppercase">Portal to Ireland (start)</span>, transitioning to <span class="text-uppercase">Portal to Ireland (end)</span> as the portal opens. Players presumably ask to go through. Go to [Western Ireland](#western-ireland) section.**

**If they have not examined painting or chess board yet:**
Evangeline urges you to complete your search of the library before you move on, to make sure you didn’t miss anything.

**If the forget to bring globe:**
Evangeline urges you to take the globe with you lest you need it again, and in one step, you cross thousands of miles.
</div>

### Chessboard
<div class="scripted" markdown="1">
**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Chessboard</span>.**
You go over to the chess table, which has a built-in drawer.

“When he’s not out galavanting, my husband loves to spend his afternoons beating Jeremiah at chess,” Evangeline offers.

“He doesn’t always win,” his assistant grumbles, indignant.

**If they open the drawer, show <span class="text-uppercase">Chess Pieces</span>:**
You find several chess pieces inside.

**If they place the chess pieces on the board:**
Hmmm, nothing seems to be happening.

**If they try to take the chess pieces:**
“Please, I’d prefer if you left those here,” Jerry says. “I need the practice.”
</div>

### Painting
<div class="scripted" markdown="1">
**Show <span class="text-uppercase">Painting</span>.**
Evangeline informs you that the beautiful woman in the portrait is the Professor’s first wife, Saoirse. You notice there are hinges on one side of the frame.

**If they fiddle with the painting, show <span class="text-uppercase">Behind the painting</span>:**
The painting swivels to reveal a hidden compartment. Inside, you discover a bottle of vinegar and one of butterbur. The vinegar reads 'For sticky situations' and the butterbur reads 'For respiratory maladies'.
