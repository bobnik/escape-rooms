# Script
Use this script as a companion to the slide deck. As players' explore rooms, read the prompts as needed. Pay close attention to triggered responses to players' actions.

## Preamble

<div class="mt-4 pt-4 px-4 bg-light border" markdown="1">
**While waiting for everyone to join, show Waiting Room.**

**After everyone arrives, show Getting Started.**

Thanks everyone for joining us tonight for Creature Caper, our online escape room. Does everyone have a pencil, paper, and the handout ready? Great! Some basic tips before we start:

* You get clues by interacting with objects or characters.
* What you see and hear will include everything that you need to solve the puzzles. I encourage you to speak up as you figure things out - it keeps everyone on the same page.
* Investigate each area thoroughly before moving to the next and take notes, but you don’t have to sketch maps or symbols. If you need to see something again, just ask.
* If you get stuck, you may be missing information. Leave, collect more clues, and come back later.
* And finally, once you use an object, you won’t have to use it again, so you can cross it off of your list. There’s one exception to this rule, but we’ll make it obvious.

Is everyone ready? Great! The clock starts now! Welcome to Creature Caper!

## Professor's Library, Newton, MA

**Show Evangeline and Jerry.**

The message to come to the manor was urgent. “Tell no one,” it said.

The woman who ushers you into the library seems distracted. “Evangeline,” she says in lieu of a more formal introduction. “And this is Jerry, my husband’s assistant,” she adds, gesturing to the young man by the fireplace. “Thank you for coming. I’ve heard you’re the best, and I need the best. This is no ordinary case. You see…it’s my husband, the Professor. I’m sure you’ve heard of him. He’s the world’s foremost magizoologist, and a founding member of the Museum of Supernatural History. Well, he’s missing. It all started when the book he’s writing, a compendium of magical creatures, was stolen. Then creatures started disappearing. He set out to catch the culprit, and then we received this…” she hands you a telegram.

**Show Telegram.**

Creatures indeed missing, twelve thus far. Have reached the location of the latest creature-napping and am tracking a possible accomplice. If you do not hear from me by tomorrow evening, send help. Would share more, but I suspect I am being watched and my letters intercepted. 55 16 1 N. 6 28 21 W. The Professor.

“The future of the magical world is at stake,” Evangeline says. “So...will you take the case?”

**If anyone tries to be smart and says no:**

Why did you accept the invitation to come here tonight??

**Once they say yes, show Backpack.**

Before you begin searching for clues, you tuck the telegram into your trusty backpack--you’d never go into a new case without it. It’s pretty empty now, with only a bar of palmolive inside, so there’s plenty of room for evidence or useful tools you find.

**Show Professor's Library.**

Now that that’s taken care of, where would you like to look for clues first?

The coordinates to Ireland, their next location, are contained in the telegram: *55 16 1 N, 6 28 21 W*.

### Skull

“I hate that thing,” Jerry says, shuddering. “It’s James, the Professor’s previous assistant. He got too close to a dragon’s treasure...at the Professor’s urging, of course. Went about as well as you would guess. I can’t believe he keeps it...so morbid.

### Cloche (glass case)

Examining the cloche, you decide to pick it up--and find a button underneath!

**If they push the button:**

Hmm, nothing seems to be happening.
