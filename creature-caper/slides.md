# Slides
Use these [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UjjHCA8qc5cWrPXDoWVhv8keBv2_e_pIx4EPoLqAon0/edit?usp=sharing) as a companion to the [script](../script).

* When presenting, use Presenter View (drop down next to the Present button). This will open a second window that lets you jump to specific slides without using the arrow keys.
* Some slides have transitions added. In these cases, it's better to use the arrow keys to move between slides. Go through the slide deck using arrows at least once to familiarize yourself with the transitions before you run a session.
* On the <span class="text-uppercase">Witch's curse</span> slide, as the players are solving the puzzle, if you are using Zoom, you can annotate their progress.
  * Click the Annotate button.
  * Select a stamp using the Stamp button (check mark for YES, x for NO) and use it to mark the players' choices in the grid.
  * Be sure to Clear all sections and turn off Annotate (click button once more) when you are done with this slide.
