# Welcome to Online Escapes!

Online Escapes are free online escape rooms that we've created that you can run for your friends. You'll only need the resources provided, and a video conferencing app like Zoom. These escape rooms were born during Covid, as an alternative our usual annual in-person Halloween parties. They were well-received and we decided to publish them online for anyone to use.

We hope you enjoy them!

&mdash; Becca and Bob
